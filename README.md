<h1>Elastic Stack SIEM Implementation and Security Event Management</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I successfully implemented and configured Elastic Stack SIEM in a home lab environment. The setup included deploying a Kali Linux VM and configuring Elastic Agents for efficient log collection and forwarding data to the SIEM, enabling robust security event monitoring.I gained practical experience by generating and analyzing security events using Nmap on the Kali Linux platform, which enhanced my ability to query Elastic SIEM for identifying and investigating security incidents. This project allowed me to develop a custom dashboard within Elastic SIEM, enabling effective visualization of security events and showcasing my skills in data interpretation and pattern recognition. Additionally, I created and tested alert rules for detecting specific security events, demonstrating my proficiency in proactive incident response and alert management.
